# SSV-Coverage

**Coverage graph creator from BAM files.** 

## Motivation
SSV-Coverage is a **python 3** script developed to create coverage graph from BAM files containing read alignments. 

## Principle

 1. A configuration file containing all program parameters is parsed and verified.
 2. BAM files are used to determine the depth of coverage at each position in the sequence. This depth is written in a BED file.
 3. The depth of coverage is then normalized by dividing the depth at each position by the total number of sequenced bases along the sequence.
 4. The graph of coverage is created.

Only a part of the sequence can be represented in the graph.

## Dependencies

The following dependencie is required for proper program execution:
* matplotlib

## Get SSV-Coverage

Clone the repository 
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/emlec/SSV-Coverage.git my_folder/
```

## Usage

Prepare the configuration file including files and settings as indicated in the template Conf.txt.

```
Usage: SSV-Coverage.py -c Conf.txt [-i -h]

Options:
  --version      show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -i BAM_NUMBER  Generate an empty configuration file adapted to the number of
                 bam files to create coverage graph and exit. [Mandatory]
  -c CONF_FILE   Path to the configuration file [Mandatory]
```

An empty configuration file can be generated by running the program with the option `-i`. 
All options are extensively described in the configuration file.
The test files present in the folder /test/dataset/ can be used to control the installation of the SSV-Coverage program.

``` bash
$ cd ./test/dataset/
SSV-Coverage.py -c example_conf_file.txt
```

The expected results are presents in the folder expected_results.
